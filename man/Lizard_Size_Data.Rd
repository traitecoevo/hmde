\description{
A subset of data from Kar, Nakagawa, and Noble (2024), used to model growth
behaviour in a skink species.
Observations are of the length from the tip of the nose to the start of the cloaca.
Data was prepared by taking a simple random sample with replacement of 50
individual IDs among individuals with at least 5 observations each. Data was
then transformed to conform to the needs of a model data set in the package.
