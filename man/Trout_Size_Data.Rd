\description{
A subset of data from the SUSTAIN trout capture-recapture data set
from Moe et al. (2020).
Observations are of total body length in centimetres.
Data prepared by taking a stratified sample of individual IDs based on the
number of observations per individual: 25 individuals with 2 observations,
15 with 3, 10 with 4. Within the groups a simple random sample
without replacement was used. Data was then transformed and
renamed to match the required structure to act as demonstration for
the package.
