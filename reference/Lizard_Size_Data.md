# Skink size data - Lampropholis delicata

A subset of data from Kar, Nakagawa, and Noble (2024), used to model
growth behaviour in a skink species. Observations are of the length from
the tip of the nose to the start of the cloaca. Data was prepared by
taking a simple random sample with replacement of 50 individual IDs
among individuals with at least 5 observations each. Data was then
transformed to conform to the needs of a model data set in the package.

## Usage

``` r
